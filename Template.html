          A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in
          the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car
          from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization
          schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique
          cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification
          criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by
          major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC) in the
          UK.

          Clothing is a generic term for garments originating from a previous
          era. The phrase is also used in connection with a retail outlet, e.g.
          in vintage clothing store. Today vintage dressing encompasses choosing
          accessories, mixing vintage garments with new, as well as creating an
          ensemble of various styles and periods.
